##Teamwork Reflections


This is where I will dicuss the three teamwork skills I wrote on in my Teamwork Qualities or PuppyDog assignment that I am wanting to put forward


##Communitcation 


I want to make sure that we are all talking about what needs to be getting done on the weekly basis so there is no confusion. 

##Knowing my role


I plan on holding myself accountable for what it is that I am assigned to do by the group no matter what the task may be.

##Respect for all ideas


I plan on fully listeing to every idea that is pitched before I make any decisions wheater the idea be bad or good.
