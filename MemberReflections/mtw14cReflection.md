## Matthew's reflection

In order to counter the common sources of project failure, I think it is 
necessary that we follow agile development principles. I believe assigning agile
team roles, as outlined in Chapter two of the reading. Dividing 
responsibilities, in particular assigning the responsibility of an agile coach, 
would be extremely helpful. As the book expresses, when something is everyone's 
responsibility, it is nobody's responsibility. 

I believe utilizing the concept of agile sprints/iterations will help us mantain
momentum, forcing us to make consistant progress on the project instead of
waiting until the last week to get work done.
