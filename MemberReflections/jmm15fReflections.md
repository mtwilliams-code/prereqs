##Teamwork Reflections
>This is where I will speak on how I plan to emulate the three teamwork skills I spoke on in my Teamwork Qualities or PuppyDog assignment

##Tolerance
> I plan on being sure to respect every one's ideas and not eviscerating the idea just because I don't like it. I am going to listen to the ideas and then if I disagree with them I will be polite instead of being rude. I will show tolerance for every one's ideas. 

##Work Ethic
> I plan on holding myself to a standard that will allow us to get things done and take the initiative to push things forward where I can. When others are slacking off I will try to push myself to pick up the slack. If other people just don't know how to do something I will speak with them about switching so that we all can bring our best work ethic to our individual parts of the project.

##Positive Attitude
> I plan on fostering a positive attitude. I will leave my bad days at the door whenever we come in for a meeting about our project. This will allow all the rest of my team to focus better on the project instead of my bad attitude. I also will plan on being there for the rest of my team so that if they are in a bad place that they will be able to hopefully bring in a positive attitude when you are working on your project.
