## Teamwork Reflections
> This is where I will speak on how I plan to emulate the three teamwork skills I spoke on in my Teamwork Qualities or PuppyDog assignment

## Tolerance
> I plan on being sure to respect every one's ideas and not eviscerating the idea just because I don't like it. I am going to listen to the ideas and then if I disagree with them I will be polite instead of being rude. I will show tolerance for every one's ideas. 

## Work Ethic
> I plan on holding myself to a standard that will allow us to get things done and take the initiative to push things forward where I can. When others are slacking off I will try to push myself to pick up the slack. If other people just don't know how to do something I will speak with them about switching so that we all can bring our best work ethic to our individual parts of the project.

## Positive Attitude
> I plan on fostering a positive attitude. I will leave my bad days at the door whenever we come in for a meeting about our project. This will allow all the rest of my team to focus better on the project instead of my bad attitude. I also will plan on being there for the rest of my team so that if they are in a bad place that they will be able to hopefully bring in a positive attitude when you are working on your project.

## Why Projects Fail
> Now to speak on why Projects fail and how I plan to prevent that.

## Lack of Time
> Firstly, when doing a complicated project people will overestimate their abilities and say that they can get more done than they really can. I plan to help prevent this by being sure that we have a solid plan going forwards and being sure that we take on only as much as we can for sure get done.

## Lack of Thought
> What this means is that people when crunched for time have a tendency to freak out and lose control of what is going on. I hope to help prevent this by being sure that we get things done on time and if we are running behind than to pick up the slack for whoever I can. If I am the one running behind than I will be sure to ask for help so that we present a quality produt rather.

## Lack of Skill
> This simply means that when you have a team of people if you don't have some people with some experience with the process you will run into problems as your team learns the process. The only way I can help with this is to speak with people with more experience whenever I run into problems so that I can increase my own experience.
