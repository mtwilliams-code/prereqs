# TeamWork Reflections
>Here I will address how I plan to provide the three teamwork skills I talked about in my PuppyDog assignment


## Communication
> I think that our team should make a Slack channel for our assingment. This will make communicating amongst our team convenient.
> It will also give us a record of all of our conversations about the project and keep our discussions of our on project on topic.  
> I also will plan to always keep the other members of my team aware of what we are working on. 


## Cooperation
> I will happily listen to other team members opinions on how we should approach parts of our project. 
> I also will let others have first say about what parts of the project they think they'll be best at. 
> I don't mind doing less interesting or highly demanded work, if it will mean the team in general is more excited about their specific tasks. 


## Shared goals
> I think that the best way for me to approach this objective in this setting is to allow other team members their space and to work on my assigned portion of the project.
> I also need to be willing to help others with the things they are working on. 

# Part 2
> Here I will reflect about the WhyProjectsFail assignment

## Planning
> Our team will need to make sure to assign tasks to each person so that we know how to proceed with our project.
> We will also need to have an idea of how we are going to build our project. 
>We need to make a plan for what kinds of technology and systems we want to use. 

## Leadership
> Having a leader in this kind of situation will be difficult because we are all students and all have similar bases of knowledge. 
> I think more likely than having a leader, we will have each person in charge of a part of the project and we will all be expected to communicate with one another about our parts. 

## Adaptability
> We will obviously need to be able to adapt. While this project is still limited in scope, it does still require us to figure out new technologies.
> We must be ready for things to not work the way we expected them to, or for us to have to try a new system when things do not work.
