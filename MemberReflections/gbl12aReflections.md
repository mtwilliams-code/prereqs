# TeamWork Reflections
>Here I will address how I plan to provide the three teamwork skills I talked about in my PuppyDog assignment


## Communication
> I think that our team should make a Slack channel for our assingment. This will make communicating amongst our team convenient.
> It will also give us a record of all of our conversations about the project and keep our discussions of our on project on topic.  
> I also will plan to always keep the other members of my team aware of what we are working on. 


## Cooperation
> I will happily listen to other team members opinions on how we should approach parts of our project. 
> I also will let others have first say about what parts of the project they think they'll be best at. 
> I don't mind doing less interesting or highly demanded work, if it will mean the team in general is more excited about their specific tasks. 


## Shared goals
> I think that the best way for me to approach this objective in this setting is to allow other team members their space and to work on my assigned portion of the project.
> I also need to be willing to help others with the things they are working on.
