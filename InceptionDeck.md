# Inception Deck

## Why are we here?
> To learn principles of software engineering by simulating a software development environment.
> Our client is "ACU". (It's really Dr. Reeves.)

## Elevator Pitch
> Professors need to be sure that the students in their class meet the requirements for the classes they are in. We're building a program to do this. 

## Product Box
> Ease of use. Take big ugly piles of data and sift through them without hassle on the part of the user. 

## Not List
> Making a GUI. Not building a parser for the CSV. Not rebuilding anything that we already have. 

## Show the solution
> Input: CSV
> Thing: Java command tool that can query a database to ensure that students have required prerequisites for a course. 

## What keeps us up at night?
> Size of data set. 
> Writing SQL queries

## Size it up
> This a month project. 

## Be clear what's going to give
> listed from most to least important
> Time 
> Quality
> Scope
> Budget is N/A

## What's it gonna take?
> It's 3 weeks
> It's gonna cost nothing in $$, but much in time.
> Our team is set by the professor. We can't pick our participants, but we can have a positive attitude and work together.
