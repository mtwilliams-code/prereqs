How to Run
========================
To build, enter prereqs directory and execute `mvn package`. This will build the project into a compiled JAR. 



Maven basic commands
---------------
`mvn validate`: validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available

`mvn compile`: compile the source code of the project

`mvn test`: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed

`mvn package`: take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.

`mvn integration-test`: process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run

`mvn verify`: run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria

`mvn install`: install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally

`mvn deploy`: done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
